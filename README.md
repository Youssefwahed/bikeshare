# bikeshare
										 The project is about US bike-share data


project details

In this project, we will use data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. we will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
Statistics Computed
we will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, we'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of the day
#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
The Files
To answer these questions using Python, we will need to write a Python script. To help guide our work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and we will do our scripting  in there also. we will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

what are other resources to help me in solving tasks in the project:

(1)-before being accepted in the professional track I watched some videos about python and its libraries NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib
-for python: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAyE_gei5d18qkfIe-Z8mocs
-for numpy, pandas, and matplotlib: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH0em1f_fBoQCPsgroUfTVwVU53lRg0D6

(2)I used pylint :Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells.

(3) I used https://stackoverflow.com :
-for understanding how to create a new column to get the weekday name from Date column formatted to DateTime: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60339049/weekday-name-from-a-pandas-dataframe-date-object
